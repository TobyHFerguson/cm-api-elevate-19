The `get_cluster.py`, `get_cluster_hosts.py`, `get_cluster_services.py`, `get_clusters.py`, `start_cluster.py`, `start_service.py`, `stop_cluster.py`, and `stop_service.py` scripts relate to Tom's part of the presentation. These should run on the QuickStart VM without modification.

The `add_new_node.py`, `add_service.py`, `cdh_upgrade.py`, and `delete_node.py` files, as well as the `cluster_deployment` directory relate to Jay's part of the presentation. Many of these relate to multi-node clusters, so they won't run on the QuickStart VM (but CloudCat will provide an alternative).
